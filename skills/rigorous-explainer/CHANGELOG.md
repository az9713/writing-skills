# Changelog — rigorous-explainer skill

## 2026-09-12 — Textbook-derived editorial style takes precedence

Updated the always-loaded `SKILL.md`, `references/pedagogy-checklist.md`, and
`references/figures-and-animation.md` to follow the comparative style findings
from 12 supplied machine-learning PDFs. Added `references/textbook-style.md`
with the nine transferable elements, source-specific evidence, and an advanced
technical chapter pattern. Consequential problems, local definitions and
assumptions, interpreted derivations, worked cases, evidence boundaries, and
developed prose now govern presentation. Removed the obligatory everyday
"Section 0," one-figure-per-proof rule, visual-per-screen quota, and demand to
show every routine algebraic step. Figures and animations now need a specific
teaching purpose. Existing HTML validation and domain-specific figure checks
remain available when relevant.

## 2026-07-04 — Learnings from Modules 4–6 captured (4 documentation changes)

Four edits folded lessons from building Modules 4/5/6 of the biomechanics course into
the skill, so they are not re-discovered per module. All edits were made with the Edit
tool against existing files (exact-string anchors). No scripts changed in this batch —
these four are documentation; the two *scripts* they reference (`check_proofs.py`, and
the `checktex.py` control-char gate) were added earlier the same day (see "Related
enforcement" below).

Guiding principle: **the highest-frequency judgement rules must live in the
always-loaded `SKILL.md`** (references are loaded on demand and were being missed
mid-build); detailed how-to lives in `references/`; the two crisp mechanizable cases are
enforced by scripts in the hardening loop.

---

### Change 1 — Hoist two build rules into the always-loaded `SKILL.md`
**File:** `SKILL.md` (workflow steps 3 "Derive rigorously" and 4 "Visualize").
**Why:** the §6 proof gap happened because "uniform rigor across siblings" lived only in
`references/pedagogy-checklist.md`, which is loaded on demand and wasn't in context
during the build. Only `SKILL.md` is guaranteed loaded. (A sibling Pillar-4 statement of
the same rule was added at line 31 during the earlier §6 fix.)
**How implemented:** two Edit calls.
- Step 3, appended after the "validate…reproduce." sentence:
  > **Prose lives in the HTML, computation lives in the scripts.** Write the section's
  > prose and proofs *directly in the `.html`* … **Never author section prose inside a
  > Python raw string** … prose-in-code evades the aloud audit … **Uniform rigor across
  > siblings:** if one boxed result in a section gets a `.prop`+`.proof`, its peer boxed
  > results … must be proved the same way … `check_proofs.py` flags the crisp case …
  > the keyresult-vs-proof call is a judgement — eyeball each section's boxed results.
- Step 4, replacing the "one representative figure approved first … Remotion …" tail:
  > **When a figure exists to show effect X … verify the computation actually produces
  > X — print the punchline number — *before* building the figure around it** … **Match
  > the model to the figure's job:** if honest first-principles dynamics belongs to a
  > later lab, use a cleaner kinematic/prescribed-input decomposition … and *label it as
  > such* … the **splice-pipeline hazards** (viewBox collisions, marker asserts, portrait
  > `max-width`, figure renumbering, unbounded-curve arrows): `references/figures-and-animation.md`.

### Change 2 — New "Splice-pipeline hazards" section in `figures-and-animation.md`
**File:** `references/figures-and-animation.md` (new `## Splice-pipeline hazards
(learned the hard way — Modules 4–6)`, inserted after the "Reusable figure toolkit"
section, before "Get the geometry RIGHT"); plus a twin-axis clause added to the
"Labels must clear the curves" section.
**Why (incidents this session):** a viewBox-keyed re-splice clobbered §2's Fig. 5 with
§3's Fig. 6 (shared `0 0 482 285`); a forgotten `<!--FIG-->` marker; a portrait network
figure rendered ~1000 px tall; inserting the FBD figure renumbered the response grid
(Fig. 13→14) and broke a reference; Maxwell creep clipped flat read as bounded.
**How implemented:** one Edit adding the section (five bullets) + one Edit extending the
data-aware-labels bullet. The five hazards:
1. **Assert exactly one marker** — `assert s.count(marker)==1` in every splice script.
2. **Re-splice by unique `aria-label`, never by viewBox** (viewBox dims collide).
3. **`width="100%" style="max-width:300px"`** on portrait/schematic SVGs (`check_frame`
   won't catch on-page scale).
4. **Figure numbers shift on insert** — after any insert/delete, grep `Fig\. [0-9]`
   downstream and re-point.
5. **Don't clip an unbounded curve flat** — stop at the frame edge + `marker-end`
   arrow + "unbounded ↑"; an asymptote line is a claim, draw it only where it holds.
Twin-axis clause: a diagonal reference curve (Φ, `k(x)`) has no fixed empty side — place
labels in the band between it and the primary curve, or delete a redundant text label.

### Change 3 — New "Sim fidelity" bullet in `pedagogy-checklist.md` §4
**File:** `references/pedagogy-checklist.md` §4 (after the "Uniform rigor across
siblings" bullet, which was itself enriched).
**Why:** in §4 of Module 6 the first two catapult-sim formulations produced no
decoupling (amplification ≈ 1.0×); a figure nearly shipped around a non-effect. Also,
the sibling-rigor audit needed explicit *exemptions* so it doesn't over-flag.
**How implemented:** one Edit that (a) appended exemptions to the uniform-rigor bullet
(a definition, one-line substitution, cited standard like **Hertz contact**, or
empirical fit like **Hill's 1938 equation** is *stated, not proved*), and (b) added a new
bullet:
> **Sim fidelity: verify the effect before you draw it.** … print the punchline number
> … *before* building the figure … **Match the model to the figure's job** … use a
> cleaner kinematic/prescribed-input *decomposition* … label it as such … make
> **known-limit validation** routine (the SLS → Maxwell/Kelvin–Voigt; the MTU → the
> rigid tendon as k→∞).

### Change 4 — New §8 "Windows Python + Unicode" in `math-html-gotchas.md`
**File:** `references/math-html-gotchas.md` (new `## 8. Windows Python + Unicode: write
and print in UTF-8`, inserted after §7, before "Subresource Integrity").
**Why:** figure generators emit `σ ε τ Φ ≈ → ↑` constantly; on Windows the cp1252
default crashed `open(...,'w').write(...)` and `print(...)` twice during the build.
**How implemented:** one Edit adding the section:
- **Writing:** `open(path, "w", encoding="utf-8")` (and `encoding="utf-8"` to read).
- **Printing:** run with `PYTHONIOENCODING=utf-8 python gen.py`, or keep prints ASCII.
- Note: not a rendering bug — the HTML is fine once written; the script dies first.

### Related enforcement added earlier the same day (context, not part of these 4)
- `scripts/checktex.py` — now hard-fails on stray control chars (TAB/VT/FF/BS/BEL/CR),
  the fingerprint of `$…$`/backslash math mangled by a double-quoted shell. Paired with a
  new rule in `math-html-gotchas.md §7` ("never splice math through a `"…"`-quoted shell").
- `scripts/verify_dom.py` — added a **swallowed-prose** advisory (inline `$…$` that ate a
  sentence — the residual no-control-char case checktex can't see).
- `scripts/check_proofs.py` — **new**; flags a `.prop`/`.thm`/`.lem` with no adjacent
  `.proof` (advisory). Added to the hardening loop in `SKILL.md` and the project
  `CLAUDE.md`.
